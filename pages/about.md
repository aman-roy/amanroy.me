Hi, :wave: <br><br>
Thanks for stumbling upon my little space on the web. Presently, I am in the final year of my B.tech degree. I am majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about Competitive programming, Cryptography and Blockchain. 

I started coding at the age of 13. I build and break things as fast as I can. I like coding because it's
fun for me. I write my spells in Python. Apart from that, I also use C, C++, JavaScript and Shell. 

My most of the time goes into <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aman-roy">writing code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68145586-aman-roy">reading books</a>, and speedcubing.


The best way to connect with me is by shooting me an <a href="mailto:royaman8757@gmail.com">email</a>. My public key is <a target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/amanroy">3E0F 4707 D0DD 596E</a>. Do it without thinking twice. I love socializing.
