Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Thanks for stumbling upon my little space on the web. Presently I am a Third year undergrad at <a target="_blank" href="http://ghrcem.raisoni.net">GHRCEM, Pune</a>. I am doing major in Computer Science. Basically, I am from a small town - <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrah">Ara</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar">Bihar, India</a>. I am passionate about Competitive programming, Cryptography and Blockchain.

I started coding at the age of 13. I build and break things as fast as I can. I like coding because it's
fun for me. 

Most of the times, I write my spells in Python. Apart from that, I also use C, C++, JavaScript and Shell. 

My most of the time goes into <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/aman-roy">writing code</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68145586-aman-roy">reading books</a>, and speedcubing.

The best way to connect with me is by shooting me an <a href="mailto:royaman8757@gmail.com">email</a>. My public key is <a target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/amanroy">3E0F 4707 D0DD 596E</a>. Do it without thinking twice. I love socializing.
